# Statistics Interview Questions

## Descriptive Statistics

### 1. What is the purpose of descriptive statistics?

Descriptive statistics help us make sense of large amounts of data by summarizing it in a simple and understandable way. Instead of looking at every individual data point, we use descriptive statistics to see the big picture. It includes tools like:

- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of variability (range, standard deviation)
- Graphs and charts (like histograms and pie charts)

These help us quickly understand what the data looks like, spot trends, and identify any unusual patterns.



### 2. Can you explain the difference between mean, median, and mode?

These are three ways to find the center of a dataset:

- Mean : It is the average of all the numbers. You add them up and divide by how many there are. It can be affected a lot by very high or very low numbers (outliers).
- Median : It is the middle number when the data is arranged in order. It isn't affected much by outliers, so it gives a better idea of the typical value when data is skewed.
- Mode : It is the number that appears most often. It's useful when we want to know what value is most common, especially with categories.

Each of these helps us understand the data from a different angle.



### 3. How do you interpret the standard deviation of a dataset?

Standard deviation tells us how spread out the values are from the average (mean):

- A low standard deviation means the numbers are close to the mean, the data is consistent.
- A high standard deviation means the numbers are more spread out, there's more variability.

It's a useful way to see whether most values are clustered together or scattered widely across the range.



### 4. Describe the concept of skewness in statistics.

Skewness shows whether the data is symmetrical or lopsided (asymmetrical):

- Positive skew (right-skewed): Most values are on the lower end, but there are a few high values stretching the tail to the right. The mean is higher than the median.
- Negative skew (left-skewed): Most values are on the higher end, but there are a few low values stretching the tail to the left. The mean is lower than the median.
- Zero skewness: The data is perfectly symmetrical.

Skewness helps us understand the shape of the data and whether extreme values might be affecting the average.

## Inferential Statistics

### 5. What is the main goal of inferential statistics?

Inferential statistics allow us to make educated guesses or predictions about a large group (population) based on information from a smaller group (sample). Instead of analysing everyone, we analyse a few and then use that to say something meaningful about the whole group.

We use it to test hypotheses, estimate values, and measure the reliability of our conclusions. It’s especially useful when collecting data from an entire population is too expensive or time consuming.



### 6. Explain the difference between a population and a sample.

- A population is the entire group you’re interested in studying, for example, all college students in a country.
- A sample is a smaller group selected from that population, like 500 college students from different states.

We study the sample and use the results to make predictions about the whole population. This approach is more practical and cost effective.



### 7. What is a confidence interval, and how is it useful in inferential statistics?

A confidence interval gives us a range of values that we believe contains the true value we are trying to estimate (like the average income of a city). For example, if a survey estimates the average income per month is ₹30,000 with a 95% confidence interval of ₹28,000 to ₹32,000, we are 95% confident the real average lies within that range.

Confidence intervals help us understand how accurate our estimates are and how much uncertainty is involved.



### 8. Define p-value.

The p-value helps us test if the results of our study are statistically significant. It tells us how likely it is to see the results we got or more extreme ones if there were actually no real effect. In other words, if the null hypothesis were true.

- A low p-value (usually less than 0.05) means the result is unlikely to have happened by chance, so we reject the null hypothesis.
- A high p-value means the result could have easily happened by chance, so we don’t have strong enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

It’s a key part of hypothesis testing in statistics.
